Aaliya over the summer ran an experiment assessing the effect of transplant shock on rootbound red mangroves. 20 trees she transplanted from 3 to 4 inch treepots, 20 trees she cut the bottom 2 inches off the roots then transplanted from 3 to 4 inch treepots and 20 untransplanted trees as a control. 

This project is plotting the monitoring data from that experiment and making figures for her CERF poster
